# Xtract

Xtract is a GUI that helps in parsing structured tabular data from PDF files into CSV format.

### Tech Stack

- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - Javascript library to build cross-platform desktop application
- [Tabula-py](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py) - A framework to parse PDF data to Pandas Data Frame
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - Computer Vision library. Included in project to parse graphs

Numpy and Pandas are used to handle data within the Python ecosystem.

### [WIP]

Contributions are welcome. Please make sure all the files added are placed in correct folder. For Python scripts, place your script in python directory - `./python/`. If the directory doesn't exit, please create one.
